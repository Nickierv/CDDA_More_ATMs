This helps address cash card clutter and the lack of ATMs.

ATMs are added anywhere you would walk into at random and make a small purchase. This should make them findable but not so common you are tripping over them.

List of changes:
Arcade
Bar
Bowling Alley
Grocery0 - Its the one that didnâ€™t come with an ATM.
Laundromat
Pizza parlor
Fast food restaurant

Known bugs
- Only about 1 in 3 buildings will spawn with the new ATM. This is still enough that a normal size 4 town will have three or four buildings with an ATM they normaly don't have. Likly due to code based map gen.
- The fast food restaurant may have a bear trap on the ATM. Likly caused due to code based map gen.
